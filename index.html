      <p>Other web design tools attempt to remove the need for the developer or the designer. They do this because there's a communication problem.</p>
      <p>Building a static comp is not really building. It is the barrier between the designer and the developer. When the comp is finished, the designer thinks they have "built" the website, as far as designing it goes. Truthfully, the comp is the byproduct of the fundamental misunderstanding of the web design workflow, responsive or otherwise.</p>
      <p>The developer, upon being handed the comp, must then reverse-engineer and even (to some extent) re-design it. "Design comps" provide no working base; they are by definition non-functional. But design is not how it looks or feels&mdash;it's how it works. And when a developer receives a non-working byproduct, they must start from scratch. After all, the design specified in the comp might not even work once implemented.</p>
      <p>This is not necessarily the designer's (or developer's) fault. Building a website requires knowledge of both design and code, and it is unlikely to find someone who does both very well. The process of web design, then, necessitates that the designer and developer be in constant communication. This calls for better tools.</p>
      <p>Some ignore what tools they use, saying that a tool is just a tool. To a degree, this is true. A great photographer can capture a great photo with a crummy camera. But, it must be a camera; nothing else will do.</p>
      <p>If static comps don't cut it, then the designer needs a new tool. Not just any tool, but a tool for the modern web in which the devices and screens and needs of users are ever changing. The designer needs a tool that lets him design, and that means producing a product that is worthy of a good web developer.</p>
      <p>Meet Plaid. Plaid lets the designer meet the developer. With a focus on the fundamentals of good web design (layouts) and using a postmodern grid, the resulting product is HTML/CSS/JS, i.e. a website. The resulting code is clean and semantic. We believe that HTML should be so simple a secretary could write it; HTML ought to just reflect your content. The CSS uses a technique called the "Isolation Method" which removes any float rounding issues. The result is a true What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) without the bloat or mess.</p>
      <p>In other words, Plaid produces a website foundation that is truly designed, from the inside-out; a functional product.</p>

      <p>A musical instrument is more than a tool. It breeds creativity. It takes on the personality of the person using it. It produces music, sounds that transcend the physical and meld our experience and trigger our emotions.</p>
      <p>What is the product of a web design? Is it a website? A website borders on the physical and virtual realm. It can be seen, touched, interacted with; but what it is, a series of bits of 1s and 0s, cannot be seen. What we see, much like when we read, must be translated into something that relates to the physical world around us, and this based on our experiences and beliefs. A website, then, must be interpreted like a work of art. A painting is hung on the walls, the canvas emoting the work of the painter. By itself, it does nothing. It relies on the coming of a viewer to interpret and imbibe its meaning. A musical act has more power, filling the room and even affecting our surroundings. But it too must rely on a listener to feel, to act upon it.</p>
      <p>Really, the website embodies several works of art: it contains words, images, music, even video. All this considered, it is a high task to undertake a web design. It is a meta-art, a design for something that is already a work of art. Much like a frame for a painting, or the cover of a music record, a web site design can add, subtract or otherwise embellish the works of art that it contains.</p>
      <p>A frame or music cover, however, has a physical goal. A website on the other hand, has no such goal. Yet, there must be something to guide its purpose and to provide order among the chaos. Simply, it it this: The layout. A newspaper or magazine understands this. Their mediums physically guide their purpose and even their layouts, which must point to the art within as best as possible without distraction.</p>
      <p>Notably, a web design has no such obvious physical limitation, as it can be manipulated at any time by the viewer. The browser window can change; the font size can change; the device can change. In today's marketplace, we struggle with the juxtaposition of the ever-changing worlds of art and technology, as we seek to bring them together.</p>
      <p>The art of web design needs to match its technology. No longer can fixed layouts be acceptable. No longer should other devices such as phones be considered second-class. The world of the web is universal, and the web design should reflect this. To do this, layouts must be designed without regards to any fixed size. Proportions should reign. The Fold should be of limited concern.</p>
      <p>The create these layouts, a traditional grid will not do. If the layouts are based on proportions, then the layouts will have to change when the proportions no longer work. The grid needs to be malleable. And it cannot just use the simplistic notion of columns. The focus ought to be the content. The content and the grid need to be closely related, if not identical.</p>
      <p>To this end, we have discovered the postmodern grid. While it is an abstraction, it is a distillation of the fundamental understanding of web design as an art and not just a means to an end.</p>
