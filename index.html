    <p>A musical instrument is more than a tool. It breeds creativity. It takes on the personality of the person using it. It produces music, sounds that transcend the physical and meld our experience and trigger our emotions.</p>
    <p>What is the product of a web design? Is it a website? A website borders on the physical and virtual realm. It can be seen, touched, interacted with; but what it is, a series of bits of 1s and 0s, cannot be seen. What we see, much like when we read, must be translated into something that relates to the physical world around us, and this based on our experiences and beliefs. A website, then, must be interpreted like a work of art. A painting is hung on the walls, the canvas emoting the work of the painter. By itself, it does nothing. It relies on the coming of a viewer to interpret and imbibe its meaning. A musical act has more power, filling the room and even affecting our surroundings. But it too must rely on a listener to feel, to act upon it.</p>
    <p>Really, the website embodies several works of art: it contains words, images, music, even video. All this considered, it is a high task to undertake a web design. It is a meta-art, a design for something that is already a work of art. Much like a frame for a painting, or the cover of a music record, a web site design can add, subtract or otherwise embellish the works of art that it contains.</p>
    <p>A frame or music cover, however, has a physical goal. A website on the other hand, has no such goal. Yet, there must be something to guide its purpose and to provide order among the chaos. Simply, it it this: The layout. A newspaper or magazine understands this. Their mediums physically guide their purpose and even their layouts, which must point to the art within as best as possible without distraction.</p>
    <p>Notably, a web design has no such obvious physical limitation, as it can be manipulated at any time by the viewer. The browser window can change; the font size can change; the device can change. In today's marketplace, we struggle with the juxtaposition of the ever-changing worlds of art and technology, as we seek to bring them together.</p>
    <p>The art of web design needs to match its technology. No longer can fixed layouts be acceptable. No longer should other devices such as phones be considered second-class. The world of the web is universal, and the web design should reflect this. To do this, layouts must be designed without regards to any fixed size. Proportions should reign. The Fold should be of limited concern.</p>
    <p>The create these layouts, a traditional grid will not do. If the layouts are based on proportions, then the layouts will have to change when the proportions no longer work. The grid needs to be malleable. And it cannot just use the simplistic notion of columns. The focus ought to be the content. The content and the grid need to be closely related, if not identical.</p>
    <p>To this end, we have discovered the postmodern grid. While it is an abstraction, it is a distillation of the fundamental understanding of web design as an art and not just a means to an end.</p>
